# Kennel Mate

## An application designed for animal shelters and their pups, kittys, and others.

### Description:

This application has the ability to project your shelters information. If you have multiple shelters connected in any way be it a non-profit or a county then multiple shelters can be displayed. It also has the ability to present a running list of all the animals within your organization that can be deleted or added using our delete button or add animal form. You can also add a new shelter and update any of the animals that are already listed by using the see more link.
